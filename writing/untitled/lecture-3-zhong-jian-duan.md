### 主题段 2

**确定分论点**

In the second place, children are more easily interested in foreign languages and pick them up naturally at an early age.

**解释分论点**

As is generally known, curiosity about new things is the **inborn nature** of any child. In their eyes, the world is full of **mysteries** that are waiting for them to explore. A new language is one such.

> inborn nature：天性
>
> mystery：神秘的人或事物（可数名词）

**权威 —— 名言警句**

Just as the famous saying goes, "Interest is the best teacher."

**因果关系**

Inspired by passion, they may start to regard learning the language as a hobby.

**现象 —— 举例（排比论证）**

Reading interesting stories written in it, watching foreign cartoon videos, listening to songs by foreign singers, speaking and using it in daily life; all these are good habits in learning a language.

**假设关系**

If these habits can **be kept persistently**, these children will surely become excellent speakers in the future.

> be kept persistently：坚持下去

**故事 —— 举例**

My little sister is a perfect example. She picked up English as a hobby when she was only 7 years old. Since then, she has **stuck to it with perseverance**. Thanks to her marvelous English skills, she has **been admitted to** a famous university in the United States.

> stick to it with perseverance：坚持不懈（同义词替换）\
> perseverance：毅力，坚持
>
> marvelous：了不起的；惊人的
>
> be admitted to：被录取
