# Day10 综合写作拆解

## 1. 综合写作形式

### 流程

1. 考生被要求先用 3 分钟**阅读一篇学术文章**\
   重点看**开头、主体段**的每一句，**主体段的连接词后面紧跟的句子**和**结尾**
2. 找出这段话中的**讨论问题**（用 1-2 句话概括），**文章的总论点**（用 1-2 句话概括）和 **3 个分论点**
3. 听一段关于**同一个话题的 2 分钟的 lecture**，说话者会提出刚才阅读的学术文章中 3 个分论点的态度（绝大多数是反驳，且顺序对应）
4. 开始综合写作，在 20 分钟内完成一篇 150-225 字的短文，**介绍说话人用哪 3个理由反驳阅读段落中的 3 个分论点**（阅读文章仍在屏幕左侧）

### 核心能力

1. **概括能力**
2. **引证能力**\
   综合写作考试中只允许 citation，而不允许 quotation，如果照抄原文 6 个或者更多单词，一般来说违反了考试要求\
   对于比较生僻的专业术语来说，少量的直接引用也是合理的

### 注意

* 文章类型：类似 GRE 的 Argument 的初级版
* 两类人
  * 对写阅读文章的人的称呼：the reading passage / the reading / the brife reading passage / the author of the passage（不可以简称为 the passage）
  * 对听力段子或者讲话人的称呼：the professor / the instructor / the lecturer / the presenter / the speech / the prefessor's talk / the presentation
* 三重门
  * 看清阅读文章里讨论的**总体话题**到底是关于什么的
  * 特别注意阅读和听力中的逻辑**连接词**，它们的前后信息很重要
  * 注意**语法错误**
* 另外
  * 综合写作是学术性写作，应避免缩写
  * 综合写作不要出现 I, me, you, we, us 这类主观词
