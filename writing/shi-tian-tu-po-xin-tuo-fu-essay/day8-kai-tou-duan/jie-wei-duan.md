# 结尾段

## 1. 什么是结尾段

永远不要让结尾段成为开头和主体段的机械重复

## 2. 结尾段的类型

### 领导式

回顾主体段的观点，可能展望一下未来

#### 示例1 —— 大学教育

**In conclusion**, university education **should not be **made free.** I believe in that because **the colleges need the money to make them better. **If **the universities are free, taxes **will be** raised and people** will have to** pay for things they might not use.

#### 示例2 —— 老师

**In conclusion, I have shown that** it's better for teachers to encourage their students to questionthings **Without **curiosity** there can **be **no **education.

### 家长式

概括主体段观点，但是语气更加温柔，委婉

#### 示例1 —— 学生和老师

**For those reasons, we can safely conclude that** classmates** are too important a factor to ignore and** they have more important influence than teachers on students' success at school.

#### 示例2 —— 教育

**There's nothing wrong with** studying on your own.** For the best possible learning, though**, a teacher is the biggest help you can have.

#### 示例3 —— 家庭

**Therefore, even though** many jobs come together to make a house a house, a house becomes a home **only when** people who live in it try to make it a place where they **truly **belong.

### 愤青式

对话题冷眼相待，把自己的价值观表达清楚

通常先用

* Appearently, ...
* Clearly, ...
* Needless to say, ...
* It goes without saying that...

表示对辩论的话题表示不屑，然后用

* However, ...
* But, ...
* Yet...
* Nevertheless, ...
* Still, ...

表明自己的态度的结束语

#### 示例1 —— 经验

**Needless to say**, both sources are important to us. **But in my opinion**, knowledge from experience is even more important **because **without experience, **it's almost impossible to** understand knowledge from books' or to understand how to apply this knowledge in real life.

#### 示例2 —— 老年人

The elderly** are a valuable part of society and deserve to be** treated as such, **not to be **put in a home somewhere forgotten about **because **people think they are a burden. The elderly **should be able to **live comfortable and productive lives, surrounded by their loved ones for whom they **once **cared.

#### 示例3

I don't think we should categorize people before we listen to their views. NFL superstars **are not necessarily more** capable than average people** in terms of **judging the value of a water treatment plant. **When **celebrities advocate a cause, their opinions **should be only one of the many factors that we consider in** evaluating that cause.

### 小秘式

顺着说写作给出的观点

#### 示例1 —— 音乐

**I would like to say that I personally agree with the statement that **music tells us something about a culture, and **with my example I wanted to illustrate** how much of the culture of a country it is possible to learn about just listening to its music.

#### 示例2 —— 教育和玩乐

**I agree that** formal education at an early age offers children benefits at all levels **and therefore is** more important than letting them play. **After all**, kids can always play after school but learning at school stimulates their brain growth and puts them in competitive social settings, **which is indeed irreplaceable experience** for such a critical stage of life.

### 和稀泥式

结尾也不表明任何观点，用于“折中式”写法

#### 示例1 —— 独立

The time to live independently **depends on** the person himself. He** must decide whether** they're ready to leave their parents to have an independent life **or not**. **The decision will vary from one person to another**. A person should judge that he's capable of fulfilling his needs without being dependent on his parents; this indicates that he's ready for his independent life. **Otherwise **he might need to stay longer with his parents.
