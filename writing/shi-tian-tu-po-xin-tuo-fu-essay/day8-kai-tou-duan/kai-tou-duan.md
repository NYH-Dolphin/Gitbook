# 开头段

## 1. 什么是开头段

开头段实质上永远为了下面 4 个目的中的某一个或某几个服务

1. 介绍社会、自然或生活**背景 **                    （这个目的必要时可以忽略）
2. 介绍文中要讨论的**话题**                             （这个目的一定要讲）
3. **转述**原题中给出的关于这个话题的观点 （这个目的有时也可以忽略）
4. 概括自己对讨论话题的**态度**                     （这个目的一般都会在开头段直接或者间接地给出）

## 2. 开头段的类型

对于考试，掌握 2-3 种方案即可

### 开门见山

* 优点：立场鲜明，适合用来写“一边倒”文章的开头段
* 缺点：开门见山的开头段很可能比别人的开头段短，需要考虑到如果主体段不够深入就有可能过短

#### 示例1 —— 家长是否是孩子最好的老师

**There is a principal reason for agreeing with the statement that** parents make the best teachers and **it is the fact that** children are closer to parents than to any other people.

#### 示例2

**The best way to know** what's going on in a society** is to** study its popular media **because **social trends, people's fears and aspirations, the status of various groups and the power of the ruling elites can all be seen in the popular media of this society.

#### 示例3 —— 是否应该做自己不喜欢但必须做的工作

In reality, from time to time we **all have to** do things that we don't enjoy. **And contrary to what many people believe**, the fulfillment of obligation** is actually **more important to achieving job satisfaction than enjoyment at work.

### 缠绵悱恻

* 优点：比较文艺清新，反复，可以用于一边倒，也可以用于折中式
* 缺点：必须要是自己有感而发的原创

#### 示例1 —— 家长是否是孩子最好的老师

**When we think about** the relationship between parents and their children, **we can say** parents are the first teachers of their children, **hence the idea of** parents being the best teachers. **There are several reasons for that**, such as parents being the first people who their children met, children having spent most of their time with their parents and children having grown up with their parents' care as well.

#### 示例2

**In our** media-intensive **culture**, **it is not difficult to find differing opinions**. **Thousands of** newspapers and magazines and **dozens of** ratio and television talk shows **all resound with differing points of view**. **So for the **audience, **now the difficulty lies in deciding **which opinion to agree with and which "experts" seem the most credible. **The more **inundated we become with differing opinions and claims,** the more essential it is** to hone critical reading and thinking skills for us to evaluate these ideas.

### 欲扬先抑

一开头就先把自己要驳斥的观点亮出来，甚至还“欲情故纵”地说一两句支持它的理由，之后马上亮出自己的观点，用三个主体段铺天盖地陈述反对的理由

* 优点：适合于驳斥型议论文

#### 示例1 —— 学校更应该支持体育还是图书馆

**Some people claim that** universities should allocate as much money to sports facilities as to the libraries **because **sports can help students keep fit and cope with the heavy workload. **But in fact**, as an academic institution, universities do have the obligation to give higher priority to the funding of libraries than to that of athletic facilities.

#### 示例2

**There's an adage that says**, "Knowledge is power,"** the implication being that** knowledge breeds success. This adage is wrong. It's not knowledge that's power;** it's the** application of knowledge that provides the power which contributes to success. **We all have** encountered knowledgeable people who are not nearly as successful as they should be.

#### 示例3 —— 经验是最好的老师吗

"Experience is the best teacher."** is an old cliche**. **But it's nonetheless possibly true because **the most important, and sometimes the hardest lessons we learn tend to come from our participation in situations.

#### 示例4 —— 领导整个小组还是做组员更好

Being a member of a group and being the leader of a group **can both be desirable**. **Actually, I think these two roles are interrelated**. **However, it's very likely that **being the leader can bring an individual more satisfaction and delight.

#### 示例5 —— 电视会让人减少交流吗

**Some people think that** television has destroyed communication among friends and family.** It may be true that **on average, most modern people spend a couple of hours in front of a TV every night. **But I believe it's an exaggeration to say **television has caused a "communication breakdown" among friends and family members. **Or even if it does, that only happens to** **those **most passive, unthinking TV viewers who are not good at communicating with others anyway.

### 忆苦思甜

先感叹过去不堪回首，再对比今天的幸福生活，而作者的倾向性已经暗含其中

* 优点：适合用来讨论现在比过去有明显进步的现象，比如科技类话题

#### 标志性词语

| 过去                                                                                                                         | 现在                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <ul><li>Historically, ...</li><li>Traditionally, ...</li><li>used to...</li><li>It was not uncommon for... to...</li></ul> | <ul><li>At present, ...</li><li>Currently, ...</li><li>In this day and age</li><li>In present-day society,</li><li>These days,</li><li>In today's society,</li><li>In the present age,</li><li>In contemporary society,</li><li>Nowadays,</li></ul> |

#### 示例1 —— 是否应该经常搬家

For centuries, people have been moving from one part of the world to another. **In the past**, people moved mainly as a result of natural disasters or due to political upheavals or wars. **Today**, though, we move to seek a fortune or better careers prospects, or just to see the world.

#### 示例2 —— 家长和教师是否有权决定孩子的未来

**During the Industrial Revolution**, in many European countries children worked up to 19 hours a day in dingy factories at a very early age and the factory owners could beat those who fell asleep at work or didn't work fast enough. **But now** even parents or teachers are not completely free to do things as they please to the kids because they're entitled to protection and far more rights.

### 忆甜思苦

* 优点：适合用来讨论交通、环境、动物或者涉及价值观改变让人担忧的话题

#### 示例1 —— 广告是否是对生活有帮助

**In a **simpler **time**, advertising **only **called attention to the products. **But now **it manufactures a new product of its own: the consumers. **That's because today **advertising not just emphasizes the advantages of products, but also promotes ways of life.

#### 示例2 —— 是否应该在任何适合都保持诚实

The **traditional **virtue of telling the truth in all situations** is increasingly doubted by many in today's world**. **Many believe that **telling the truth is not always the best policy when dealing with people...

#### 示例3 —— 现代人们是否需要冒险

All of us crave adventure, at least at some time in our lives.** Yet even though our ancestors had plenty of **adventure, **we can only find** it on TV or the Internet today. Senior executives tucked away in offices, professors stranded in ivy-covered buildings and doctors overworked in emergency rooms **all dream of **mountain-climbing or deep-sea diving or traveling through Amazon jungles.

### 如数家珍

将主体段各个分论点在开头就陈列出来

* 优点：实诚，有一说一
* 缺点：开头和主体每段的第一句话会略显重复，只适用“一边倒”式的文章

#### 示例1 —— 更支持私家车还是交通工具出行

Government should definitely spend more money on improving all forms of public transit. The widespread use of private cars **has contributed to some serious problems in society**, including **depletion of natural resources**,** increased pollution** and **the loss of a sense of community**. By encouraging the use of public transportation, governments can do a lot to counteract these problems.

#### 示例2 —— 外貌是否真的很重要

People often behave differently, depending on what they wear. The reason is not that they have changed, but that people's reactions to them have changed. **Strangers **react to your appearance because it is all they know about you. A **friend **may be influenced by your dress also, if it is appropriate for a situation. In addition, appearance is almost always important at **work**.

#### 示例3 —— 朋友和亲人谁对小孩的性格影响更大

Although friends definitely play a significant role in shaping teenagers' personalities, it is the parents and siblings that have a far greater impact on the development of their personality traits. **There're intellectual, emotional and financial reasons for my view**.

### 针锋相对

在开头段列出主体段各方的观点，少数情况也不一定要在开头段表明自己的观点，而是可以选择在主体段双方都论证之后，在结尾段表明自己的倾向性

#### 示例1 —— 多元文化是否是好的

**Many Americans feel that** the Multiculturalism policy is essential to America because it has recognized different cultures, giving them equal importance and social representation. **In contrast, some other Americans have pointed out that** official Multiculturalism has reduced the essence of culture to outward, superficial symbols such as music, dance and food, instead of providing equal opportunity, status and power to the diverse groups. The American society is thus divided into the "mainstream", which has power, and the "multicultural minorities."

#### 示例2

**Some people think that** the history of a country is only shaped by battles and political victories because they determine the course of history. **Many others, however, think that** a nation's history is also shaped by the underlying structures of culture, language and religion as they often reveal the key characteristics of the land that has molded a nation's past and present.

#### 示例3 —— 公司是否应该外包

Many American companies have decided to outsource jobs performed by Americans to workers in other countries. **This issue has fast become controversial**, **as some advocates of **outsourcing **see it as **the only way to keep their companies competitive. **Opponents, though, view it as** the number-one reason for unemployment in the United States. Who's right?

### 现身说法

一上来就用自己的亲身经历现身说法，凭真诚取胜

#### 示例1

**The motto** "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again" **is a saying that I agree with**. **One example that comes to mind is **a long-term struggle to maintain a healthy weight. **Even as** a child, **I preferred** sedentary activities to sports. **Honestly, I would still rather **have ice cream **than **an apple now. **Nevertheless, I have **launched several campaigns to lose weight.

#### 示例2 —— 你们国家的音乐揭示了你们国家文化的什么

**To answer the question of** “What does the music of your country reveal about the culture of your country?”, **I would like to introduce myself**. I am from Spain. I was born in a region called Catalonia, in a town near Barcelona.

#### 示例3 —— 家长是否是孩子最好的老师

**I'm blessed with** great parents. **They are **understanding, intelligent and not overprotective.** Throughout my life, they've been **supportive of my endeavors and give me sound advice when I need it from them.** I can say with conviction that **parents make the best teachers for their children.

### 断下定义

首先对题目中的关键词下定义，然后再在定义的基础上进行论证

#### 示例1

**All humans need incentives to keep working hard. That's my understanding of the word "promotion". Thus, it seems to me **companies that implement merit-based promotions will have a competitive edge in attracting talent.

#### 示例2

**Animals include **wild creatures, pets and livestock kept on a farm.** Even though **humans raise pigs and sheep solely for meat, **I don't think the same thing should be done to wild or domestic animals.**
