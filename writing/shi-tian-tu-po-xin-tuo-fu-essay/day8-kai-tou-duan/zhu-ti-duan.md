# 主体段

## 1. 什么是主体段

主体段是新托福拿分的最主要的地方，它体现了考生对于考题的理解和考生是否有深入论证话题的能力

主体段的首要要求是每个论证环节是否符合逻辑

## 2. 主体段展开方式

### 顺延

不使用明显的连词或者连词很少，句子之间仅凭语意自然的过渡，或后面的句子解释前面的句子

* 优点：靠每句话的语意自然衔接，考生需要对自己在该段内想要表达的意思又深刻的领会，并在开始写作前就对段落内部结构做到心中有数
* 缺点：模仿起来需要多花一些功夫，是比较高端的写作手法，完全不使用连接词是很难的

#### 示例1 —— 教育

I believe that parents' involvement in most American public schools has been declining. Today, parents are puzzled by all the new teaching methods and the new terminology used to introduce them. They can't find out what their kids are supposed to be learning, let alone whether or not they are being properly educated. The shortage of textbooks, the flexibility of standards, the lack of work coming home, the computerized report cards —— all help to keep parents away from schooling. And well-intentioned teachers have been effectively discouraging parents from helping their kids at home on the grounds that the students may be confused by the different approaches. The result? Even more distance.

#### 示例2 —— 动物

Pets can substitute for the absence of other family members. Sometimes a couple who is unable to have children will adopt pets and treat them like babies. They show on their pets the love that they might have provided a child and receive affection and companionship in return. Many people who live alone enjoy the companionship of a pet instead of loved ones who are at a distance or have passed away. The pet becomes a family member for these people and deserves the same kind of treatment that a family member would receive.

#### 示例3 —— 教育

Other challenges that students face are the constant temptations that surround them every day. Cell phones, music players and even video games are all being carried into classrooms. With the general noise and confusion in today's classroom, it's easy to hide and even use them during class, which prevents the user and often people around them from getting the most out of the curriculum.

### 并列

几个分论点属于同级并列关系

* 优点：写起来顺手，考生广泛使用，不容易失误
* 缺点：使用人数多，特色不明显

#### 注意

* 永远不要在写议论文时只写分论点而不写它的**支持句**，否则文章会变成堆砌分论点的流水账，缺乏深入的论证，不过支持句也不需要太深刻，符合常识即可
* 新托福写作主体段分论点后的支持句是全文使用连接词、加分句型和变换句式最频繁的地方

#### 标志词

* First of all,
* In the first place,
* To begin with,
* Second,
* Also,
* ... as well
* Another reason is...
* For one thing, ... For another, ...
* Third,
* Lastly,
* Finally,
* Last but not least,

#### 示例1 —— 友情

Close friendships have numerous benefits. **For one thing, loyal friends are always there to support each other, no matter what happens**. Some friendships last many years, becoming deeper and more meaningful with time. **Also**, people can be themselves with friends. No one has to worry about not being perfect when he/she is among friends. **Finally, nothing can be more satisfying than the intimate conversations that true friends can have. **They can confide in and trust each other.

本段分论点1、2、3后各有一句支撑句

#### 示例2 —— 邮件

Even though E-mail has the advantages of being convenient, speedy and economical, I believe E-mail has its downside, too. **For example, there's no guarantee of privacy**. If you use E-mail at work, the computer is your employer's property so he/she has the right to monitor it. **Also, there may be misunderstandings because people often dash off quick E-mails to others**. Since the recipient can't see or hear the sender, he/she may mistake the sender's tone for something that has not been intended. So E-mail is not really appropriate for formal business correspondence. Rather, it's only good for quick and informal messages.

#### 示例3 —— 科技

I believe **technology can positively contribute to humans' keeping alive of traditional skills and ways of life**. For example, the populations of some Pacific islands are too small to have regular schools. Their educational authorities have been able to use the Internet to deliver schooling online to the local kids** rather than **sending them to the mainland. **Also, modern refrigeration technology has been used to keep alive the traditional ways of producing salmon**.** As a result**, they can now be ordered from and delivered to anywhere in the world.

### 递进

与段内并列有时候没有本质区别，只是分论点层次感更加清晰，用段内递进时，有时候第一个分论点前的标志词可以自然省略

#### 标志词

* The primary reason is...
* ... is primarily...
* The principle factor is...
* The main concern is...
* The chief consideration is...
* Moreover, ...
* Furthermore, ...
* Apart from...,&#x20;
* Aside from...,
* Besides, ...
* What's more, ...
* In addition, ...
* Additionally, ...
* Worse yet, ...
* Better yet, ...
* More exactly, ...
* More precisely, ...
* Specifically, ...
* More importantly, ...
* The most significant reason why... is...

#### 示例1 —— 运动

Many people enjoy participating in sports for recreation because it offers an opportunity to be part of a group. As a participant, you can join a team and enjoy all the benefits of membership, from shared experiences to a sense of belonging. **Moreover**, in training for a sport, an exercise routine contributes to your health.

**Probably even more important than** group identity and good health **are **the life lessons that participation in a sport provides. Setting a goal and working toward it, collaborating with others and putting a plan into action are all good lessons that can be learned on the playing field.

#### 示例2 —— 交通

I don't think biking is a safe means of transportation in America -for three reasons. **To begin with**, in my experience, many different pieces of bicycle equipment can be unreliable and may cause bike accidents. For instance, if a bike does not have good brakes, it cannot be stopped effectively. Similarly, a weak light will make it difficult for a biker to see at night. **Aside from** defective equipment, a biker may have difficulty controlling his/her bike when it's windy or rainy, which is common in many American cities. Under such conditions, water may obstruct the biker's view. **And I believe most** bike accidents are actually caused by bikers who do not stop at a stop sign or by bikers whose pants' legs get caught in the bike chain.

#### 示例3 —— 医疗

Socialized health care systems generally don't make sense. **First**, socialized medicine is extremely expensive - no matter how it is paid for. **For example**, in Sweden and Saudi Arabia, **two medically socialized countries** (句中插入短语), the costs have increased to approximately (使用副词) 40 percent of the budget of each country each year. **Specifically **(具体来说), in Sweden, this money comes from high taxes **while **(对比) in Saudi Arabia, it comes from petrodollars. **More than that**, the socialized system is rarely efficient. **Often **(状语前置), it's hard to find an appropriate doctor. **Worse yet **(更糟糕的是), it's even harder to get examined by a doctor. According to one recent case in Algeria, a woman had to wait eight months just to have her tooth pulled out. That's because in countries with socialized medicine, everyone wants to go to the doctor or dentist, **no matter** how small the problem might be (让步).

### 因果

因果关系是逻辑中最基础的关系之一

* 缺点：适合“一边倒”型主体段的写法

#### 示例1 —— 多媒体

**I think serious TV shows can be used as supplementary teaching tools**. For many American students, once they get back home, the first thing that they do is to turn on the television. **Therefore**, recommending to their serious TV shows that contain reflections on history, economy, science or social justice can really help teachers extend teaching into their students' leisure time.

只有一个论点，后面的句子都是它的支持句

#### 示例2 —— 科技

**The benefits of computer skills for young children should not be denied**. Their future adult world. will be changing even faster than ours **in terms of** technology and lifestyle. **Thus**, it's essential that today, young children can learn at an early age to use the equipment for the storage and transmission of information.

#### 示例3 —— 移民

**Many immigrant parents think that their children should become Americans as quickly as possible and don't teach their children their native language or culture. I think this is a serious mistake. **Immigrants are minorities in the U. S., **so **keeping in touch with their own culture and ancestors is essential for keeping their sense of pride and security. Someday in the future, the second-generation immigrant children will ask their parents where they came from and they will have a need to know their own culture. To understand that culture, they must learn their native tongue **because** the language is the most important element that forms the spiritual value and racial consciousness. **Therefore**, I believe while assimilation of the new language and culture should be encouraged, keeping the old one is just as important.

### 举例

#### 巧用 “:” 和 “——” 引例子

And what does writing mean to us today? We're surrounded by writing at every turn. We use it, often unconsciously, in daily activities **——** in the kitchen, at the job, or on the road.

Technology is essential to modern life**:** Every morning, people wake up to the built-in alarm in their cell phone and then go to work on a bus, in a private car or ride the subway, complete tasks with PCs or laptops during the day and watch cable channels at night.

### 类比 & 对比

#### 示例1 —— 教育

Taking a wide range of courses offers students more options for their leisure time. Past generations worked longer hours and their relatively short life expectancy did not afford as many people the possibility of a long retirement.** In contrast**, today a large number of college graduates can expect to enjoy several decades of recreational activities after they stop working. The interests that theydevelop through exploring various academic fields can be very helpful in making their retirement more enjoyable.

#### 示例2 —— 休闲

It's very interesting to discover the different personally of the Spanish regins by just listening to what their music sounds like. For example, in southern Spain, people are known for being very funny and for their good scene of humor. In this part of Spain you can find mainly two kinds of music: The Flamenco and the Sevillanas. Sevillanas has completly the personality of the Andalusian people as it is very cheerful. **By contrast**, Flamenco sounds sad and deep. The reason is that although Andalusian people also have a good mood, they live in one of the poorest parts of Spain, and they express their pain through the Flamenco music.

#### 示例3 —— 成功与失败

All of us have had —— and will continue to have-difficult experiences and failures. It's up to us to learn from them. One person who loses a job may become depressed then withdraw, and finally start to blame others for his/her problems. **In sharp contrast**, another person who does not make excuses for failures may try to identify his/her own weaknesses, choose to go back to school or go to a refresher course, switch to another career path that is better suited to his/her potential, or relocate to a more prosperous area. **Even though** these two people have had the same failure, they will end up getting vastly different results.

### 转折

#### 标志词

* However, ...
* But...
* Yet...

#### 转折与对比的区别

| 包含成分            | 转折              | 对比                              |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| A（位置在前）与B（位置在后） | 用 B 去证明 A 没有说服力 | 要证明 A 和 B 都是事实，但它们之间有差异，因此构成了对比 |

#### 示例1 —— 政府

Some people argue that socialized medical care gives all thepeople a chance for health care rather than just the rich. This might be true. **But **we might ask, "What quality of health care does it give a chance for?" According to the American Medical Association, doctors in medically-socialized countries such as Canada possess (拥有) much less skill than doctors in countries with privately-financed health care.That sounds reasonable actually: **If **a doctor has a guaranteed supply of patients.what, other than self-satisfaction, does the doctor have to improve his/her skills?

#### 示例2 —— 多媒体

Many people argue that educational media programs are too commercialized today. It's true the media have noticed the demand for adult education as a leisure-time pursuit and often speak in the language of education even while promoting their routine fare.** However, I believe that** educational programming in its best sense does exist. For example, a large number of excellent nature documentaries now sit comfortably in the prime-time schedules of broadcasters. Sizeable quantities of serious literature have found their niche in publishing companies' lists withincreasing book sales. And on the Internet, surfers can visit thousands of specialized websites featuring visual arts, poetry and classical music. All these alternative sources of art would have been very difficult to locate for all but the experts just ten years ago.

#### 示例3 —— 承担风险

**Yes**, most wealthy people tell us stories of the giant risk they took on the way to extraordinary success. **But. don't jump to the conclusion that** the willingness to take risks is a key to success. **It's deceptive because** we only hear about the people who successfully take risks but we don't get to hear about the thousands who take similar risks and lose. We know about the $50 million lottery winner but we don't know about the far more than 10 million people who took the uninformed risk of 5 dollars trying to win.

### 让步

#### 标志词

通常使用这些词制造出虚假妥协的气氛

* Granted, ...
* Admittedly, ...
* I tend to agree that...
* It's true that...
* To be sure, ...
* Surely, ...
* Few can deny that...

之后使用下列词汇转折

* However, ...
* Yet...
* Nevertheless, ...
* Nonetheless, ...
* Even so, ...
* Still, ...
* Despite that, ...

#### 示例1 —— 交通

I don't think cars are necessarily "greener" than airplanes. **Granted**, one flight consumes more fuel and causes more pollution than a single car journey. **However**, air trips carry far more passengers than car rides. Therefore, given the amount of pollution produced per passenger per kilometer travelled, a car journey is no more fuel-efficient or environmentally-friendly than a flight.

#### 示例2 —— 音乐

In my opinion, music tells us a lot about a culture. For example, one can learn a lot from the Spanish culture by just listening to Spanish music in his/her room. **Even so**, it is **not **easy to collect a representative sample of the Spanish music because of its enormous variety: every region of Spain has its own music that sounds completely different from the rest. And in some regions, there are even more than one type of typical music. This variety is very important because it shows that Spain is a country of various cultures, each one with a particular personality.

### 假设

对于托福写作来说，除了用到假设关系的连词外，还有一种经常用到的虚拟语气，或者反问句的高级形式

#### 示例1 —— 课程

Taking a variety of subjects provides a common core of knowledge for all educated people. **If** students limited their courses to their major fields of study, they **would not** have a broad view o the world. Their vision **would be** very narrow and they **would not** be able to exchange views with others whose education** had been** limited to the study of a different field.

#### 示例2 —— 教育

The reason I prefer that teachers encourage their students to be skeptical about what they're taught is that in education and science, many things we think that are true are really not. An example —— for many years it was thought that the earth was flat. But it turned out that the earth was round. **If** education **had never **encouraged students to question what they were taught, this discovery** might not **have been made.

#### 示例3 —— 朋友

In any relationship of mine, I would wish that first of all, the person I'm dealing with is honest Even if he/she thinks that he/she did something wrong that I wouldn't like, Later on if I find out about a lie or hear the truth from someone else, that'd be much more unpleasant. **In that case how can I ever believe or trust that person again? How can I ever believe that this person has enough confidence in me to forgive him/her and carry on with the relationship from there?**

### 转述

在实在想不出支持句的时候，还可以让主体段充实的一招妙棋

#### 标志词

* In other words, ...
* —— that is,
* —— that is to say,
* By that I mean, ...
* What is meant by that is...

#### 示例1

Another reason I'm against students being in control is that it means students won't study as much. **By that I mean** if students get to pick the program, they'll only pick the areas they like.Maybe one student will only study history, another chemistry. This can be good, but a student should study all subjects. Teachers can make sure the students study everything and get a better education.

### 下定义

下定义是一种体现考生对话体的理解比较深入的抢高分的方法

#### 示例1 —— 成功

Successes in our lives are hugely influenced by the quality of our thinking, **which means** how we view the world, how we interact with the world and what we think of our own actions and thoughts. Without proper thinking, people who are financially rich may find themselves having a poor quality of life.

#### 示例2 —— 社交技巧

In addition, social skills are very important to achieving success because people enjoy being around socially-skilled people. Social skills **are, essentially**, the abilities to manage relationships and the emotions of others. Every time we interact, we have the potential to make others feel better —— or worse —— than they did before, depending on what we do and how wedo it. Socially-skilled people know emotions can be contagious and always try to make others feel good. Who doesn't want to be in the presence of those who make them feel good? Who hasn't had the experience of witnessing how a spark of laughter lightened the mood of a whole room?

#### 示例3 —— 假期

I believe vacations are essential to modern life. When work is too hard or so easy that it becomes repetitive, we feel we must escape. We have become so fascinated with the "time out" that we yearn for them all year long and would be outraged if anyone tried to take them away from us. **To many of us, vacations are the time** when we're "forced" to take it easy, to spend the money we have devoted most of our lives to earning, and to feel that we are truly alive as compared with the rest of our existence, and by far a greater part of it that we spend at work.
